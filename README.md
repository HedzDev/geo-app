# geopedia
Geopedia is a react native app that displays information about countries.

### `Expo Go`

You need to install Expo Go (https://expo.dev/client) to launch the app on your smartphone. 

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Once you cloned or downloaded the project, type `npm install` on the project root to install node_modules dependencies, and then type this behind to launch the project :

```
npm start 
# or
yarn start 
```

Once you've done that, a QRCode appears on your IDE terminal, and you have to flash it to display the app on your mobile.
